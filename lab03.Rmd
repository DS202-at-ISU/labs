# Overview

In this activity we are going to

1. reshape a data set, and then
2. use the data to fact-check some statistics in a published report. 

The deliverable is, again, a team-edited report.



---

# Getting Ready

1. Identify your team! Go to Canvas and find out which team you are in for Lab 3. There are 12 teams with 3 or 4 members.

2. If you are participating remotely, find your teammates via Slack / email. You can use any platform for collaboration that works for you all (Microsoft Teams, discord, WebEx, Zoom, etc)
If you are in the classroom, find the other members of your team and sit with them.

3. Introduce yourself to each other. 

4. Go to https://ds202-at-isu.github.io/labs/lab03.html and follow the instructions.

# Step-by Step

1. Accept the link to Github Classroom shared in the announcement/chat. 
  
  - This link will ask you to log in to github. Select your name from the list by clicking on it.  
<!-- https://classroom.github.com/a/pfl2YPZY-->
  - Check if your team number already exists - if it does, join the team with the right number. If it doesn't exist yet, create it yourself.

2. Overall aim of this lab: Tidy a data set, then use it for fact-checking a report.

# Data Background

The data was  collected by FiveThirtyEight. This time we are interested in a review of life and death among the Avengers, a group of super heroes in the Marvel universe; the accompanying article is published [here](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/avengers-death-comics-age-of-ultron/)

The description of the data is [here](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/avengers)

In a universe where time travel, alternate lifelines and portals with all kinds of powers exist, dying might be less permanent than in the world that we are used to.

# Data Background (2)

In 2015 FiveThirtyEight has conducted a comprehensive review of all Avengers. We can access the resulting data using the command

```{r}
av <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fivethirtyeight/data/master/avengers/avengers.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
head(av)
```

---

# As a team: Data tidying

The avenger data consists of ten columns for each avenger called Death[1-5] to Return[1-5]

Get the data into a format where the five columns for Death[1-5] are replaced by two columns: Time, and Death. Time should be a number between 1 and 5 (look into the function `parse_number`); Death is a categorical variables with values "yes", "no" and "". Call the resulting data set `deaths`. 

Similarly, deal with the returns of characters.

Answer the question: how many deaths on average, does an Avenger suffer?

---

# Individually: fact-check

Each team member picks one of the statements in the FiveThirtyEight [analysis](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/avengers-death-comics-age-of-ultron/) and fact checks it based on the data. Use dplyr functionality whenever possible.

Upload your answers and the code to the repository. Discuss and refine answers as a team.

---

# Submission

Knit the Rmd document and upload both the md and the Rmd file to the team's repository.



Due date: You have time until Monday at 11:59 pm to submit the final RMmarkdown file.

One team member: upload the team's repo link to Canvas (just to signal to the instructor that you are done)
