# Overview

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

In this activity we are going to practice how to collaborate using Github and RStudio.  
With your team members you will work on sharing and editing files on Github.

# Create Your Lab Repo in Github Classroom

Accept the link to Github Classroom shared in the announcement.
  
  - This link will ask you to log in to GitHub. Select your name from the list by clicking on it.  

  - Check if your team number already exists - if it does, join the team with the right number. If it doesn't exist yet, create it yourself.

# What You Need to Do

  - If this is the first time you use `git` on your machine, you should start with chapter 7

  - Follow the step-by-step instructions in [Chapter 12 of Happy git with R](https://happygitwithr.com/rstudio-git-github.html), use the lab #1 repo as the test repo. **Note: don't do the last step. DO NOT delete the repo!**
  
      - Check the prerequisites at 12.1, if you miss something, please read that chapter. At 12.4, please modify the `README.Rmd` file. The `README.md` file will be automatically updated if you knit the `README.Rmd`
  
  - Describe your experience: make a note of each step. In case you run into a problem, describe it and the error message. As a group try to solve the problem. Write up the solution. 
  
  - Collect all of your experiences and make it into one cohesive document. Use the `README.Rmd` file of the lab-1 repo for this document, i.e. there should be a list of all steps in Chapter 12, followed by a description of all the errors you encountered and your solutions.

# Grading & Submission


**Grading:** We expect equal contributions from all members in a team. For the grading we will make use of the github commit history to verify that everybody contributed. 


**Submission:**
All submissions to the github repo will be automatically uploaded for grading once the due date is passed. Submit a link to your repository on Canvas (only one submission per team) to signal to the instructors that you are done with your submission.


Due date: You have time until Monday at 11:59 pm to submit final edits to the README.Rmd file. Make sure that the file knits.
